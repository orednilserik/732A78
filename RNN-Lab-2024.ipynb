If you don't speak Swedish, use sentences from the validation data. It might be interesting to look at examples where the Swedish and the English word order differ substantially.\n","\n","Based on your exploration, **answer the following questions:**\n","\n","- What sentences did you try out? What patterns did you spot? Include example heatmaps in your notebook.\n","- Based on what you know about attention, did you expect your results? Was there anything surprising in them?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The sentences we tried that gave us a good result was:\n","\n","* 'solen är stor .'\n","\n","* 'himlen är blå idag .'\n","\n","* 'jag älskar den hunden . '\n","\n","They are all relatively simple sentences with not much structural differences between languages, biggest difference in structure being definite form i.e. 'himlen' -> 'the sky'. We found that it performed worse when you had inflections, partly due to context but also probably due to limited training data. It can for example recognize the word 'solen' -> 'the sun' but not 'sol' -> 'sun', making the vocabulary limited as words close to the ones chosen does not translate well.\n","\n","Especially hard to translate sentences with double substantives and adjactives, where it would translate the first correct but couldn't tell the second one was contextually independent the first and therefore often produced nonsensical translations. Attention would sometimes also give high weight to words that were completely wrong, probably due to context
